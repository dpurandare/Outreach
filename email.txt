Deepak,

I need your help in two projects: B2B outreach system and SLM for Field CoPilot.

Below is a professional, enterprise-grade B2B outreach system designed specifically around the tools you already subscribe to, the 5 JBS hero bets, and the need for human-sounding, high-trust messaging with measurable ROI. This is structured so you can actually operationalize it, not just conceptually admire it.
1. Overall Architecture (What Talks to What)
Core Spine
Zoho CRM → System of record (accounts, contacts, pipeline, scoring)
Sales Navigator + Apollo.io → Prospect discovery + enrichment
GoHighLevel (GHL) → Multi-channel outreach orchestration (email + LinkedIn assist)
LLMs (ChatGPT Pro, Claude Pro, Gemini Pro) → Research + personalization engine (behind the scenes)
Canva / Gamma / Napkin.ai → Credibility assets (1-pagers, micro-decks, visuals)
Veed.io / HeyGen → Optional high-touch video follow-ups for top-scored accounts
Key principle: AI never sends directly. Humans approve, edit, and trigger. This keeps messages natural and compliant.
2. Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) by Hero Bet
You should NOT run one generic outreach motion. Create 5 parallel ICP tracks.
Hero Bet
ICP
Buyer Personas
Generation Forecasting (Wind/Solar/CCGT)
IPPs, Utilities, Energy Traders
Head of Forecasting, VP Ops, Grid Strategy
Sales Quote Automation
Mid–large B2B services, Energy OEMs
VP Sales, RevOps, COO
Fieldforce CoPilot
Utilities, Renewables O&M firms
Head of Field Ops, Asset Mgmt
Energy Data Hub
Utilities, GenCos, Traders
CDO, Head of Data, IT Director
DataOps
Data-heavy enterprises
CDO, Data Platform Lead
Each ICP gets:
Its own value narrative
Its own scoring logic
Its own outreach cadence
3. Prospect Identification (Precision, Not Volume)
Tools Used
Sales Navigator → Account-level targeting
Apollo.io → Contact enrichment + email verification
Zoho CRM → Master list + dedupe
Process
Sales Navigator
Filter by:
Industry (Utilities, Renewables, Energy Trading)
Company size (500–10,000 employees ideal)
Geography (focus markets)
Recent leadership changes (high intent)
Export accounts → Apollo
Pull:
Verified emails
Job tenure
Tech stack hints
Push into Zoho CRM as:
Account
Contact
Hero Bet Tag (one primary)
4. Scoring Mechanism (This Is Critical)
A. Account Fit Score (0–100)
Dimension
Weight
Industry Fit
25
Asset Scale (MW, sites, users)
20
Data Complexity
20
Tech Maturity
15
Geography Priority
10
Strategic Alignment to JBS
10
B. Persona Influence Score (0–50)
Signal
Points
Decision Maker
+20
Budget Owner
+10
Recent Role Change (<12 months)
+10
Active on LinkedIn
+5
Shared Connections / Groups
+5
C. Engagement Score (Rolling)
Email open → +5
Email reply → +20
LinkedIn profile view → +10
Content click → +10
Meeting booked → +50
👉 Zoho CRM should calculate:
Copy code

Total Outreach Priority Score = Account Fit + Persona Influence + Engagement
Only prospects above a threshold (e.g., 110) move to high-touch personalization.
5. Messaging System (Human, Not AI-ish)
Golden Rule
AI writes inputs, not outputs.
Personalization Layers (Stacked)
Layer 1 – Industry Context
Grid volatility
Renewable intermittency
Data silos
Field inefficiencies
Layer 2 – Company-Specific Trigger
Recent project
Earnings call mention
New asset
Hiring trend
Layer 3 – Persona Pain
Forecast accuracy risk
Manual quoting
Technician productivity
Data reliability
Layer 4 – JBS Credibility
“We’ve helped utilities / IPPs…”
Partnered with Databricks / Azure
Domain-specific outcomes
LLM Usage (Behind the Scenes)
Tool
Use
Claude Pro
Long-form research summaries (earnings, websites)
Perplexity Pro
Fact-checked trigger discovery
ChatGPT Pro
Message drafts using strict style rules
Gemini Pro
Alternate phrasing + tone variation
Prompt Guardrails
Short sentences
No hype words
No emojis
No “transform”, “leverage”, “synergy”
One clear reason for outreach
You manually edit before sending.
6. Outreach Execution (Email + LinkedIn)
GoHighLevel Setup
Cadence Example (14 days):
Day 1 – Personalized email
Day 3 – LinkedIn profile view
Day 5 – LinkedIn connection (no pitch)
Day 7 – Value follow-up email
Day 10 – Soft nudge with insight
Day 14 – Breakup email (polite)
LinkedIn messages are manually sent, guided by AI-generated suggestions.
7. Credibility Assets (Used Sparingly)
For high-score accounts only:
Gamma → 5-slide micro-deck tailored to their industry
Canva → One-page solution brief per hero bet
Veed / HeyGen → Optional 45-sec intro video (only after engagement)
This signals seriousness and avoids spam perception.
8. Tracking & Feedback Loop
Zoho CRM Dashboards
Outreach score distribution
Hero bet conversion rates
Persona response heatmap
Time-to-first-meeting
Weekly Optimization
Kill messages with <20% open rate
Double down on personas that reply
Refine scoring weights monthly
9. One Missing Tool (Strong Recommendation)
✅ Shield AI Detector + Humanizer (Optional but Powerful)
Examples:
Originality.ai or GPTZero Enterprise
Why
Ensures messages do not trip AI-detection flags
Protects brand credibility
Especially important for enterprise buyers
This is the only addition I’d strongly recommend.
10. What This System Gives You
✔ Predictable pipeline
✔ Clear prioritization (no spray-and-pray)
✔ Human-sounding outreach
✔ Measurable ROI by hero bet
✔ Scales without killing trust

Thanks

## 🎓 Update Philosophy

**tasks.md** = **Tactical** (What am I working on right now?)
- Updated frequently (every session)
- Detailed task tracking
- Immediate work items
- Session-by-session progress

**DEVELOPER_BOOTSTRAP.md** = **Strategic** (What's the big picture?)
- Updated for major changes only
- High-level status
- Project context
- Onboarding information

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

- **tasks.md update:** 2-5 minutes after each session
- **DEVELOPER_BOOTSTRAP.md update:** 5-10 minutes after major milestones
- **Both documents read at session start:** 8-10 minutes total

---

## 🚨 Remember

- **Don't skip updates** - Context loss is expensive
- **Be specific** - "Fixed API integration" is better than "Made progress"
- **Document blockers immediately** - Don't wait until next session
- **Keep it current** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs

---

*This protocol ensures continuity between sessions and prevents context loss.*

## Legal & Compliance Considerations

### LinkedIn Terms of Service
- **Prohibited**: Scraping, automated data collection, unauthorized exports
- **Section 8.2**: "You agree that you will not... develop, support or use software... to scrape or copy profiles and information"
- **Enforcement**: Account warnings, temporary suspensions, permanent bans
- **Legal Action**: LinkedIn has sued scraping services in past (2023-2024 cases)

### Risks
- **Account Suspension**: Temporary (7-30 days) or permanent
- **Legal Liability**: Potential lawsuits for commercial use
- **Data Accuracy Issues**: Incorrect data may lead to GDPR/CCPA violations

### Safer Alternatives
1. **Official CRM Integrations**: Use LinkedIn-approved connectors
2. **Manual Methods**: Slower but compliant
3. **Partner API Access**: Apply for official partnership (expensive, time-consuming)
4. **Third-Party Databases**: Use ZoomInfo, Apollo.io (not LinkedIn data)

### Data Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR (EU)**: Obtain consent before processing personal data
- **CCPA (US)**: Provide opt-out mechanisms for California residents
- **Email Marketing**: Comply with CAN-SPAM Act (include unsubscribe)
- **Best Practice**: Only use exported data for legitimate business purposes with proper consent

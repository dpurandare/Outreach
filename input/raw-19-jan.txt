So that we can we can explore the most important and critical features of the application that we want.
Deepak Purandare 0 minutes 59 seconds
As I understand, we have, we have some of these applications that we are are using right now. So I'm aware that we are using zo.zo.com for our CRM activities and all, but I'm not.
Deepak Purandare 1 minute 15 seconds
Aware that if we are using any other application, I believe as the LinkedIn is available, but you have to take the LinkedIn sales.
Deepak Purandare 1 minute 31 seconds
Subscription separately.
Deepak Purandare 1 minute 35 seconds
That might be available, so when?

Vinod Himatsinghani
1 minute 37 seconds1:37
Vinod Himatsinghani 1 minute 37 seconds
Yes, the so we have taken sales, sales navigator.
DP
Deepak Purandare
1 minute 42 seconds1:42
Deepak Purandare 1 minute 42 seconds
Right.

Vinod Himatsinghani
1 minute 43 seconds1:43
Vinod Himatsinghani 1 minute 43 seconds
As a subscription.
DP
Deepak Purandare
1 minute 46 seconds1:46
Deepak Purandare 1 minute 46 seconds
OK, so when as we are doing our exploration, our our folks are adding information, they are exploring and adding some possible leads kind of information in Zuo.
Deepak Purandare 2 minutes 2 seconds
That I I assume that is our first point, right? And then we want to further qualify and enrich information about those leads and and want to further.
Deepak Purandare 2 minutes 19 seconds
Check all the possibilities of how we can, you know, do that outreach operation with all the possibilities that you know you mentioned.

Vinod Himatsinghani
2 minutes 26 seconds2:26
Vinod Himatsinghani 2 minutes 26 seconds
Select.
Vinod Himatsinghani 2 minutes 28 seconds
So why don't you step back a little bit? Let me tell you what we've done is we are looking at almost a a list of almost about 60 to 70 customers that we want to go ahead and target in the US. These are all energy and utility customers. So we have the list, OK.
DP
Deepak Purandare
2 minutes 32 seconds2:32
Deepak Purandare 2 minutes 32 seconds
OK.
Deepak Purandare 2 minutes 43 seconds
Mhm.

Vinod Himatsinghani
2 minutes 43 seconds2:43
Vinod Himatsinghani 2 minutes 43 seconds
From that list we've I started and we've gone to two sources. One is Apollo dot IO, the 2nd is Sales Navigator. OK, both these places have got data related to these companies. So in Apollo dot IO I typically get the name of the person.
DP
Deepak Purandare
2 minutes 52 seconds2:52
Deepak Purandare 2 minutes 52 seconds
Oh.

Vinod Himatsinghani
3 minutes 3 seconds3:03
Vinod Himatsinghani 3 minutes 3 seconds
His e-mail address and his phone number essentially and his title. Sales Navigator give me all that and it gives me an intent. So it what it does is it tells me whether this person was trying to buy something, search something, what is his?
DP
Deepak Purandare
3 minutes 8 seconds3:08
Deepak Purandare 3 minutes 8 seconds
Bye.

Vinod Himatsinghani
3 minutes 19 seconds3:19
Vinod Himatsinghani 3 minutes 19 seconds
Probabilistic idea about what is he trying to look for and what is he going to buy comes from Sales Navigator. So one there is a cross check and a match between the two that the same person exists. We get the same information from there from a standpoint of of verification of the phone number specifically Sales Navigator.
Vinod Himatsinghani 3 minutes 39 seconds
Is less reliable on phone number. Apollo is more reliable on phone number. OK and.
DP
Deepak Purandare
3 minutes 43 seconds3:43
Deepak Purandare 3 minutes 43 seconds
Or especially maybe e-mail also could be one one thing to match but.

Vinod Himatsinghani
3 minutes 47 seconds3:47
Vinod Himatsinghani 3 minutes 47 seconds
Yeah, e-mail. Yeah, e-mail typically sales because nobody can mandate LinkedIn to put your business e-mail. Lot of people put their personally. So that's why you'll get 2 emails probably from Apollo and here. So e-mail match also could happen or it could be different emails also I.
DP
Deepak Purandare
4 minutes4:00
Deepak Purandare 4 minutes
OK.

Vinod Himatsinghani
4 minutes 7 seconds4:07
Vinod Himatsinghani 4 minutes 7 seconds
Be like in LinkedIn. It's my personal e-mail right from the beginning. I don't. I mean my secondary e-mail is a Jade e-mail. OK, so but in Apollo they may have just your your because it's more sourcing from a data perspective. They're they're creators of lists.

Deepak Purandare
4 minutes 15 seconds4:15
Deepak Purandare 4 minutes 15 seconds
Bye.

Vinod Himatsinghani
4 minutes 26 seconds4:26
Vinod Himatsinghani 4 minutes 26 seconds
They sell all this information. That's their subscription. So that's I don't know whether they'll have personal or whatever it is, but typically Apollo is used for name, title, phone number and e-mail and LinkedIn has got name, title.
Vinod Himatsinghani 4 minutes 43 seconds
And then we're looking for intent, you know whether that what is the guy's doing, what's he trying to look at and everything from that perspective. So these two lists.
DP
Deepak Purandare
4 minutes 51 seconds4:51
Deepak Purandare 4 minutes 51 seconds
So sorry to interrupt, but I we have, you know, probably I will restrict myself from asking those questions that how LinkedIn is getting access to that information of you know what was.
Deepak Purandare 5 minutes 5 seconds
That person's intent and what he was buying and searching for, searching to buy and something. But but I I believe that information is kind of, yeah.

Vinod Himatsinghani
5 minutes 12 seconds5:12
Vinod Himatsinghani 5 minutes 12 seconds
Correct. I mean that's that's their model, that's their secret sauce. We don't know how they do that. They just say that this is it. This is an intent. OK, so we capture that intent and then from that intent that gets updated into Zoho, that needs to get updated into Zoho CRM.
DP
Deepak Purandare
5 minutes 22 seconds5:22
Deepak Purandare 5 minutes 22 seconds
OK.
Deepak Purandare 5 minutes 31 seconds
Uh huh.

Vinod Himatsinghani
5 minutes 31 seconds5:31
Vinod Himatsinghani 5 minutes 31 seconds
OK, the once that Zoho CRM is gets updated then we want to create a message for the based on the intent we want to create a message.
Vinod Himatsinghani 5 minutes 44 seconds
OK, personalized message and then that needs to be rolled out through LinkedIn and e-mail and any other channel we choose to connect with. So so there's an outreach happening. So this is the whole system that is required.
DP
Deepak Purandare
5 minutes 44 seconds5:44
Deepak Purandare 5 minutes 44 seconds
OK hmm.
Deepak Purandare 6 minutes 2 seconds
OK, so our application initially talks to Zoho. So we we whenever we get this this initial list, we assume that it isn't it is loaded in Zoho or we assume that it is a kind of a separate CSV type.
Deepak Purandare 6 minutes 20 seconds
Information or Excel type information that we are going to.

Vinod Himatsinghani
6 minutes 21 seconds6:21
Vinod Himatsinghani 6 minutes 21 seconds
No. So that list assume that that short list was coming from Apollo and coming from LinkedIn and this has to be loaded into CRM so into into Zoho.
DP
Deepak Purandare
6 minutes 35 seconds6:35
Deepak Purandare 6 minutes 35 seconds
So somebody's going to do some search, get the list and load it to Zoho. Is that how it should be admin? I'm trying to understand that scenario.

Vinod Himatsinghani
6 minutes 42 seconds6:42
Vinod Himatsinghani 6 minutes 42 seconds
I mean, if we can do, if you want, if we can automate that too, that means we know the list that comes from there and gets uploaded here. Great. If you think that's not important, then you know we'll then we can manually do that.
DP
Deepak Purandare
6 minutes 58 seconds6:58
Deepak Purandare 6 minutes 58 seconds
You mentioned we have initially we had list of some 6070 possible contacts. So where it where where did we get it from?

Vinod Himatsinghani
7 minutes 3 seconds7:03
Vinod Himatsinghani 7 minutes 3 seconds
Accounts.
Vinod Himatsinghani 7 minutes 7 seconds
6070 companies we want to target.
DP
Deepak Purandare
7 minutes 11 seconds7:11
Deepak Purandare 7 minutes 11 seconds
OK. So so 6070 companies we are going to be targeting. So we if I think as a an kind of a layman, I will possibly try to find out who are the the, the important people in those companies, you know we should be reaching out.
Deepak Purandare 7 minutes 30 seconds
And who are possibly linked or related to the the function of procurement or or purchase or something? Is that right?

Vinod Himatsinghani
7 minutes 40 seconds7:40
Vinod Himatsinghani 7 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah, correct.
DP
Deepak Purandare
7 minutes 42 seconds7:42
Deepak Purandare 7 minutes 42 seconds
So you will do that kind of a pointed search or you will you get the names of the company and you need to names of the people. So what is what is the process you're going to be following? I know that you know this is a general process, but you will you will search in Apollo and.
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 2 seconds
That LinkedIn sales for for finding the the names as well.

Vinod Himatsinghani
8 minutes 8 seconds8:08
Vinod Himatsinghani 8 minutes 8 seconds
That's where I go.
DP
Deepak Purandare
8 minutes 10 seconds8:10
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 10 seconds
OK, and once you get the names then you will.
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 15 seconds
You will find the more the specific information about for those individuals to qualify them for the outreach and the shortlisted, the shortlisted people.

Vinod Himatsinghani
8 minutes 28 seconds8:28
Vinod Himatsinghani 8 minutes 28 seconds
Correct.
DP
Deepak Purandare
8 minutes 31 seconds8:31
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 31 seconds
Will be targeted with this specific marketing campaign or even outreach campaign. That's what we want. You know the the the appropriate messaging, appropriate content to be generated. You know it's.

Vinod Himatsinghani
8 minutes 38 seconds8:38
Vinod Himatsinghani 8 minutes 38 seconds
Correct.
DP
Deepak Purandare
8 minutes 47 seconds8:47
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 47 seconds
Either in the e-mail, audio or video, you know, or you know, setting up some calls or something. So this is the overall theme, yeah.

Vinod Himatsinghani
8 minutes 53 seconds8:53
Vinod Himatsinghani 8 minutes 53 seconds
Yes.
Vinod Himatsinghani 8 minutes 56 seconds
Yes.
Deepak Purandare
8 minutes 57 seconds8:57
Deepak Purandare 8 minutes 57 seconds
So what is what are the most critical things? Those are, I mean Zoho for example.
Deepak Purandare 9 minutes 7 seconds
Zoho is a CRM. I haven't kind of, you know, used any any CRM so far. I mean I I was not required to, but what are what are things we get from CRM from Zoho?

Vinod Himatsinghani
9 minutes 15 seconds9:15
Vinod Himatsinghani 9 minutes 15 seconds
OK.
Vinod Himatsinghani 9 minutes 22 seconds
So.
DP
Deepak Purandare
9 minutes 23 seconds9:23
Deepak Purandare 9 minutes 23 seconds
Well, yes.

Vinod Himatsinghani
9 minutes 26 seconds9:26
Vinod Himatsinghani 9 minutes 26 seconds
It's more, it's more like a a hub, a system where you're capturing all the progress that you're making in a sales cycle.
DP
Deepak Purandare
9 minutes 38 seconds9:38
Deepak Purandare 9 minutes 38 seconds
So the individual sales people can keep you know so it it maybe you're the the the head of the sales you know the unit head is assigning the outreach or reach out you know the kind of a task to the individuals and they can.
Deepak Purandare 9 minutes 58 seconds
Play out those tasks and update the status in in that system. That's one thing.

Vinod Himatsinghani
10 minutes 1 second10:01
Vinod Himatsinghani 10 minutes 1 second
Correct. So if you see, so so if you see, let me try and kind of show you this. Let's say my open deals, OK.
Vinod Himatsinghani 10 minutes 13 seconds
Let's talk about deals become easy. Let's say master data management. Quaker hout and I'll just open this.
Vinod Himatsinghani 10 minutes 25 seconds
So this is what it looks like. OK, typically. So where you are in your cycle essentially.
DP
Deepak Purandare
10 minutes 30 seconds10:30
Deepak Purandare 10 minutes 30 seconds
But I.
Deepak Purandare 10 minutes 34 seconds
Yeah, can you hold on for for for a few seconds. So master data management, nodes, contract records, attachments, straight tree, competitive disk cadence, open activities, OK, cases emails and all OK.
Deepak Purandare 10 minutes 51 seconds
OK, so this is so whatever you are showing me, this opportunity qualified. So this is the natural progression on a natural process that that is followed for each lead till it becomes a kind of a custom.

Vinod Himatsinghani
10 minutes 52 seconds10:52
Vinod Himatsinghani 10 minutes 52 seconds
OK.
Vinod Himatsinghani 11 minutes 3 seconds

Vinod Himatsinghani
11 minutes 6 seconds11:06
Vinod Himatsinghani 11 minutes 6 seconds
So you can add your notes here. What is this note all about or opportunity prospects? What happened here? Essentially now if you see we are not really, we've not connected a lot of people. I'm not connected the emails here, but the minute you connect the emails, it all starts recording, right?

Vinod Himatsinghani 11 minutes 26 seconds
Here from your e-mail box essentially and this is sign in with Navigator. I can directly access Sales Navigator from here. So I'm doing that right now essentially. So Apollo I can't do.
Vinod Himatsinghani 11 minutes 42 seconds
But Navigator I can do from here.
DP
Deepak Purandare
11 minutes 48 seconds11:48
Deepak Purandare 11 minutes 48 seconds
OK, Zoho, I can get 15 days trial subscription, but for the sales navigator, I don't think there is any trial account available. So let me try out that thing on the Zoho for I'll I'll certainly like to explore.

Deepak Purandare
13 minutes 25 seconds13:25
Deepak Purandare 13 minutes 25 seconds
Do we have access to Apollo as well, Sir?



Deepak Purandare 13 minutes 37 seconds
Because you know I I I wanted to see what I did was I tried to get I I generated a CSV file with with with the names from the energy industry.
Deepak Purandare 13 minutes 53 seconds
And the real data actually with their with their contacts and all or whatever information available with the thought that you know I'll I'll take that information and try to enrich it and see. But unfortunately the Apollo needs Apollo said you know.

Vinod Himatsinghani
14 minutes 3 seconds14:03
Vinod Himatsinghani 14 minutes 3 seconds
OK.
Vinod Himatsinghani 14 minutes 8 seconds
OK.
DP
Deepak Purandare
14 minutes 13 seconds14:13
Deepak Purandare 14 minutes 13 seconds
You want to work with the CSV file you need. You cannot do it with trial version. So if we have, if we get, if we are serious about this, you know use of Apollo, you know might as well we get one seat license.

Vinod Himatsinghani
14 minutes 27 seconds14:27
Vinod Himatsinghani 14 minutes 27 seconds
I can, I can have there's there's a lady called Neha Sharma. She works extensively with Apollo. I'll have a demo on that Apollo to you.
DP
Deepak Purandare
14 minutes 29 seconds14:29
Deepak Purandare 14 minutes 29 seconds
Hmm.
Deepak Purandare 14 minutes 32 seconds
Oh.
Deepak Purandare 14 minutes 39 seconds
I possibly, possibly something that I can try their API with. Actually, you know, yeah, yeah, I saw that they have the API for enrichment, so you can you can upload the CSV file.

Vinod Himatsinghani
14 minutes 44 seconds14:44
Vinod Himatsinghani 14 minutes 44 seconds
OK.
DP
Deepak Purandare
14 minutes 54 seconds14:54
Deepak Purandare 14 minutes 54 seconds
And for whatever in whatever information you provided the especially the names and you know some qualifiers like e-mail of telephone number, they enrich all that in all the information and give it give it back. So I I wanted to try out that but with the the trial edition it is not working so.
Deepak Purandare 15 minutes 13 seconds
Yeah, but that will be. That will be a great idea actually, to see.
Deepak Purandare 15 minutes 23 seconds
So I will. So Vinod, I'll target it. So initially I will target that enrichment part and the second one is the messaging. I think we'll have to, we'll have to again have a session on the messaging part because.

Vinod Himatsinghani
15 minutes 26 seconds15:26

Deepak Purandare
15 minutes 42 seconds15:42
Deepak Purandare 15 minutes 42 seconds
Once we also the qualification part, there is some extensive logic that you have developed. So I need to validate that we have all the all the required information or we get all the required information through enrichment.
Deepak Purandare 16 minutes 1 second
That we that helps us in the in this automated qualification. So there's one thing is that qualify enrichment and qualification. These are the essential things. So I think we can I can.
Deepak Purandare 16 minutes 17 seconds
Especially tomorrow I can, I can, you know, spend time cycle on that. Meantime, any other, any immediate inputs you want to give?

Vinod Himatsinghani
